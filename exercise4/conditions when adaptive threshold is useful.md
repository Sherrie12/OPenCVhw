In the binary threshold, we used a global value as threshold value.
But it may not be good in all the conditions where image has different lighting conditions in different areas. 
In that case, we go for adaptive thresholding. In this, the algorithm calculate the threshold for a small regions of the image.
So we get different thresholds for different regions of the same image and
it gives us better results for images with varying illumination.
