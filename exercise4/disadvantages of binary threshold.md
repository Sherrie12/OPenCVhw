## Limited application: 
as the representation is only a silhouette, application is restricted to tasks where internal detail is not required as a distinguishing characteristic.
## Does not extend to 3D: 
the 3D nature of objects can rarely be represented by silhouettes. (The 3D equivalent of binary processing uses
## Specialised lighting is required for silhouettes: 
it is difficult to obtain reliable binary images without restricting the environment. The simplest example is an overhead projector or light box.
